# Resume Point

## Current State: Creative Brief Complete

Creative brief has been finalized for LushVerb. Ready to proceed to UI mockup or implementation.

## Completed So Far

**Ideation:** ✓ Complete
- Core concept defined: Stunning, lush algorithmic reverb inspired by BigSky
- Parameters specified: Size (0.5s-20s+), Damping (0-100%), Shimmer (always-on), Mix (0-100%)
- UI vision captured: Four horizontal rotary knobs, clean/modern/elegant aesthetic
- Use cases identified: Mixing tool + creative FX, versatile range

## Next Steps

1. Research reverb algorithms (multi-tap delay network, velvet noise, hybrid approaches)
2. Create UI mockup to visualize design (recommended)
3. Start implementation directly

## Context to Preserve

**Key Decisions:**
- Plugin type: Audio Effect (Reverb)
- Core concept: Lush, beautiful, stunning reverb—simple controls, maximum gorgeousness
- Character: Ambient/ethereal with smooth, endless tails
- Modulation: Built-in subtle chorus (not user-controlled)
- Shimmer: Always-on +1 octave, very subtle
- Damping: High-frequency rolloff only (not decay rate)
- Inspiration: Strymon BigSky, Valhalla VintageVerb, Eventide Blackhole
