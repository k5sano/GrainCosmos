# Resume Point

## Current State: Stage 1 - Planning Complete

Implementation plan created with complexity score 5.0. Strategy: Phased implementation.
- Stage 4 (DSP): 4 phases (Core Reverb, Modulation, Saturation/Filter, MOD_MODE routing)
- Stage 5 (GUI): 3 phases (Layout, Parameter Binding, VU Meter)
Ready to proceed to Stage 2 (Foundation).

## Completed So Far

**Stage 0:** ✓ Complete
- Plugin type defined: Audio Effect (Reverb)
- Professional examples researched (Soundtoys Little Plate, UAD Pure Plate, Valhalla Plate, LiquidSonics Lustrous Plates)
- DSP feasibility verified: All components implementable with JUCE
- Parameter ranges researched: Industry-standard reverb ranges documented
- JUCE modules identified: dsp::Reverb, DelayLine, IIR::Filter, DryWetMixer
- Codebase references analyzed: TapeAge (saturation, wow/flutter), GainKnob (DJ filter)
- DSP architecture created: 7 core components, complete signal flow diagram

**Stage 1:** ✓ Complete
- Complexity calculated: 5.0 (7 params + 7 algorithms + 1 feature = 9.4, capped at 5.0)
- Strategy determined: Phased implementation (complexity ≥ 3.0)
- DSP phases defined: 4 phases (Reverb, Modulation, Saturation/Filter, MOD_MODE)
- GUI phases defined: 3 phases (Layout, Binding, VU Meter)
- Implementation plan created: plugins/FlutterVerb/.ideas/plan.md
- Estimated duration: ~95 minutes total

## Next Steps

1. Stage 2: Foundation (create project structure, verify build system)
2. Stage 3: Shell (implement APVTS with 7 parameters)
3. Stage 4: DSP implementation (4 phases: Reverb → Modulation → Saturation/Filter → MOD_MODE)
4. Stage 5: GUI integration (3 phases: Layout → Binding → VU Meter)
5. Stage 6: Validation (presets, pluginval, changelog)

## Context to Preserve

**Plugin Type:** Audio Effect (Reverb)
**Processing:** Plate reverb → Wow/Flutter modulation → Tape saturation → DJ filter → Dry/wet mix
**JUCE Modules:**
- juce::dsp::Reverb (plate algorithm)
- juce::dsp::DelayLine with Lagrange3rd interpolation (pitch modulation)
- Custom LFOs (wow: 0.5-1.5Hz, flutter: 4-8Hz)
- Custom tanh waveshaper (tape saturation)
- juce::dsp::IIR::Filter (DJ-style LP/HP)
- juce::dsp::DryWetMixer (dry/wet blend)

**Complexity Score:** 5.0 (Complex)
**Strategy:** Phased implementation
**Estimated Duration:** ~95 minutes
